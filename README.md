# Regal Tailor

The Regal Tailor project is a website for a designer suit shop. It was developed with the aim of creating a sophisticated and modern browsing experience, combining interactive features with an elegant design. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to structure, stylise and add dynamism to the site.

Technologies used:

HTML:
Structuring all the sections of the site, including Hero, Collections, About, Contact, User Reviews and Newsletter.
Implementation of functional buttons and forms, such as the ‘See more’ button in each collection and the contact form so that users can send messages.

CSS:
Use of an elegant and discreet colour scheme that complements the shop's luxury brand identity.
Styling of responsive layouts with grids, making the collections section organised in columns.
Creating a clear transparency for the background image in the Hero section, ensuring that the text stands out.
Styling of elegant buttons, such as the theme switcher button (dark/light) and the ‘Shop Now’ button, which was given special prominence.
Design of a user ratings section with round photos, rating stars and animated navigation between comments.

JavaScript:
Implementation of a dynamic theme that switches between dark (default) and light mode, ensuring that the theme's colour adjusts automatically based on the user's choice.
Creation of a review section with animated navigation, where users can click on the bubbles to move on to the next comment.
Use of JavaScript to control navigation between review slides, ensuring an interactive and fluid experience for the visitor.

Project brief:
The Regal Tailor website puts fundamental web development concepts into practice with HTML for structuring content, CSS for detailed and responsive styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. Using these technologies, the project delivers a modern, functional website with a user-friendly interface.
